# Automated-Image-Captioning-with-Python-PyTorch

- Studied recent research papers on Automated Image Captioning models.
- Used Flickr8K captioned image dataset for training the model.
- Implemented Deterministic “Soft” attention mechanism of "show, attend and tell" , VGGnet CNN based Encoder, and LSTM RNN based Decoder.
- Also, used Beam search mechanism for improving caption generation accuracy- BLEU-4 score.
